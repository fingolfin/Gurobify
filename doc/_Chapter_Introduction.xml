<Heading>Installation</Heading>

<P/>
To install Gurobify, first extract it in the pkg directory of the &GAP; installation directory. You may place Gurobify in a different location, so long as its parent directory is called "pkg". Installing Gurobify outside of the &GAP; root pkg directory is not recommended, but is useful for example when administrative privileges are needed to access the &GAP; root directory. Next run the following command in the terminal from within the Gurobify directory.
<P/>
<Log><![CDATA[
./install.sh -g <gurobi path> [-r <gap path>]
]]></Log>


<P/>
The &#8208;g &lt;gurobi path&gt; is a necessary argument, and normally looks something like this on MacOSX,
<P/>
<Br/><Br/>
<P/>
&#8208;g /Library/gurobi701/mac64/
<P/>
<Br/><Br/>
<P/>
or something like this on Linux,
<P/>
<Br/><Br/>
<P/>
&#8208;g /opt/gurobi701/linux64/
<P/>
<Br/><Br/>
<P/>
The [&#8208;r &lt;gap path&gt;] is an optional argument, and is not normally necessary if Gurobify is placed in the pkg directory of the &GAP; root directory. If, however, Gurobify is located in a non-root pkg directory, then this argument must be included. It normally looks something like this,
<P/>
<Br/><Br/>
<P/>
&nbsp;&#8208;r /opt/gap4r8/
<P/>

<Section Label="Chapter_Introduction_Section_Testing_And_Documentation">
<Heading>Testing And Documentation</Heading>

<P/>
To test the package is working correctly, run the following command from inside the Gurobify directory.
<P/>
<Log><![CDATA[
gap maketest.g
]]></Log>


<P/>
 It transforms each of the examples in Chapter 4 "Examples" and the example given in Section 2.2 "Simple Example" into test cases to check that Gurobify is functioning correctly.
<Br/><Br/>
Within the Gurobify directory there is a subdirectory called "doc". This directory contains the documentaion for Gurobify in the form of a pdf file called "manual.pdf" as well as in html format. To access the html version of the manual, open the file called "chap0.html". The documentation can be regenerated by running the following command in the terminal from the Gurobify directory, though this should not be necessary.
<P/>
<Log><![CDATA[
gap makedoc.g
]]></Log>


<P/>
Regenerating the documentation will also automatically regenerate the "maketest.g" test file.

<Heading>Loading Gurobify</Heading>

<P/>
Open &GAP; and load Gurobify with the command <Emph>LoadPackage("Gurobify");</Emph>. You should see the following.

<P/>
Note that if you have Gurobify located somewhere other than the &GAP; root directory's pkg directory, then you must run &GAP; with the following command to enable &GAP; to find Gurobify.
<P/>
