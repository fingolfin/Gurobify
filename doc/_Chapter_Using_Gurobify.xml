<Heading>Using Gurobify</Heading>

This chapter documents the various commands available in Gurobify. Each command begins with "Gurobi", which in some instances helps to avoid conflict with other &GAP; commands, and is used for consistancy in other instances. Note that a Gurobify model object in &GAP; is simply a pointer to the model within Gurobi itself. &GAP; treats the models as mutable objects, and StructuralCopy should be used to create an independent copy of a model. It is also important to note that many changes to a model do not become active until the model is updated. This can be done by either optimising the model, or calling GurobiUpdateModel. It is often unnecessary to update the model if it will later be optimised, and in fact can be more efficient to only update when necessary. However, one may occasionally wish to perform a command which is dependent on previous changes to the model. In this case it is necessary to call the update command first.
<Section Label="Chapter_Using_Gurobify_Section_Creating_Or_Reading_A_Model">
<Heading>Creating Or Reading A Model</Heading>

This section deals with reading, writing, and creating models, as well as working with the model variables.
<ManSection>
  <Func Arg="ModelFile" Name="GurobiReadModel" />
 <Returns>a Gurobi model.
</Returns>
 <Description>
Takes a model file, reads it and creates a Gurobi model from it.
ModelFile is the name of the file as a string, with the appropriate extension,
and including the path if the file is not located in the current GAP working directory.
Gurobi accepts files of type .mps, .rew, .lp, .rlp, .ilp, or .opb.
Refer to the gurobi documentation for more infomation on which file types can be read.

 <Description>
Adds a constraint to a gurobi model. ConstraintEquation must be a list,
such that each entry is the coefficient (including <Math>0</Math> coefficents) of the corresponding variable
in the constraint equation. The ConstraintSense must be one of "&lt;", "&gt;" or "=",
where Gurobi interprets &lt; as &lt;= and &gt; as &gt;=. The ConstraintRHSValue is the value on the
right hand side of the constraint. A constraint may optionally be given a name, which helps to identify
the constraint if it is to be deleted at some point. If no constraint name is given, then a constraint is
simply assigned the name "UnNamedConstraint".
Note that a model must be updated or optimised before any additional constraints become effective.

<Section Label="Chapter_Using_Gurobify_Section_Querying_Attributes_And_Parameters">
<Heading>Querying Attributes And Parameters</Heading>

This section deals with obtaining information about attributes and parameters of a Gurobi model. Note that a model must be updated or optimised before parameters and attributes are updated - any queries will return the values at the time the model was last updated or optimised. Note also that the attributes are Gurobi attributes, and are not true attributes in the &GAP; sense. Crucially, attributes for a model constantly change, either as a result of optimisation or from manually setting them. Thus attributes for Gurobi models are approximated by Gurobify using &GAP; operations or functions. Their usage should still be comfortable for users familiar with &GAP; attributes.
<ManSection>
