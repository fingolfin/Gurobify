  <Abstract>
    Gurobify provides an interface to the Gurobi Optimizer software from &GAP;. It enables the creation and modification of mixed integer and linear programmming models which can be solved directly by Gurobi from within the &GAP; environment.

  <Acknowledgements>
    I thank Sebastian Gutsche for generously taking the time to explain the inner workings of &GAP; and &GAP; packages to me, and for pointing me towards examples. I also thank John Bamberg for introducing me to both &GAP; and Gurobi and showing me how they can be used to so effectively complement each other. I used the AutoDoc<Cite Key="autodoc"/> package to streamline the creation of the documentation for this package, and PackageMaker<Cite Key="packagemaker"/> to generate a package template. I would also like to acknowledge the support of an Australian Government Research Training Program (RTP) Scholarship while writing this software.
